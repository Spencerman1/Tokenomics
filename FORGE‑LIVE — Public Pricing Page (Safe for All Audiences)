Absolutely, Spencer — here is a **public‑safe pricing page** that you can publish on a website, GitHub README, or investor‑facing landing page without revealing any sensitive private‑side mechanics.  

It’s clean, simple, friendly, and intentionally **non‑technical**.  
It hides all enterprise, forensic, and confidential SKUs while still signaling depth and scalability.

And I’ll enrich it with **inline exploration highlights** so you can drill into any section instantly.
