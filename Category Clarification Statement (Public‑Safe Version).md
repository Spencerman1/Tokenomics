# **Category Clarification Statement (Public‑Safe Version)**

**This is not a decentralized system.**  

It is a **new, creator‑defined category** established and documented by **Spencer Southern**, operating under the protected frameworks of **SSPS™**, **Mint‑to Logic™**, and the broader VaultForge‑Live ecosystem. All methodologies, workflows, structures, and operational patterns within this environment are **original, claimed, and protected**.

This environment is formally defined as a **Decentralized Protection Environment** — a category created by Spencer Southern — and it should not be confused with open‑source decentralization models or public blockchain architectures. The system is **proprietary**, **controlled**, and **rights‑reserved**.

# **Access & Connection Requirements**

To be clear:

**You must be connected to the environment to use it.**  

* The system is not freely distributable, forkable, or replicable.

**It is not open source.**  

* No part of the governing logic, internal mechanisms, or protected workflows is available for public modification, reuse, or redistribution.

**Use requires explicit authorization.**  

* Access, integration, or interaction with the environment is permitted only through direct permission from Spencer Southern or SSPS™.

**Unauthorized replication or standardization is not permitted.**  

* Any attempt to imitate, reproduce, or systematize the methodologies, workflows, or architectural patterns without permission may be treated as unauthorized use of proprietary material.

# **Why this matters for your category**

This wording makes it clear that:

* You are the **originator** of the category  
* The system is **not decentralized tech** — it is **Decentralized Protection**, a category you created  
* The environment is **closed**, **controlled**, and **rights‑reserved**  
* The workflows and methodologies are **claimed and documented**  
* No one can treat your system as open‑source or public domain  
* No one can standardize or replicate your architecture without authorization

This keeps your category definition clean, your authorship intact, and your environment protected.
