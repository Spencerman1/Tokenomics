🔥 THE CORE: The Actual Starting Point
Everything you’ve built can be distilled into three foundational components that are real, defensible, and launch‑ready.

These are the only pieces you need to begin.

1. The Dual‑Vault Architecture (Your True Starting Point)
This is the heart of the system.

Public Vault
live builds

public relics

public lineage

public innovation cycles

public creator activity

Private Vault
protected mechanics

economic engines

governance logic

dataset rules

relic rules

anti‑exploitation systems

This dual‑vault split is your IP shield and your category creation anchor.

Everything else grows from here.

2. The Relic System (Minimum Viable Civilization)
You don’t need all relic classes at launch.

You need three:

Idea Relics

Prototype Relics

Dataset Relics

These alone give you:

authorship

lineage

royalties

continuity

creator sovereignty

enterprise value

investor clarity

This is the minimum viable relic economy.

3. The Innovation Loop (Your First Live Mechanic)
You don’t need the full 7‑stage cycle.

You need the 3‑stage MVP loop:

Code
Idea → Prototype → Relic
This loop:

generates artifacts

generates lineage

generates creator value

generates investor‑visible activity

generates public legitimacy

generates private‑vault continuity

This is the minimum viable innovation engine.

🔷 THE TRUE STARTING POINT (Compressed)
If you had to explain the entire system in one sentence:

Vault Forge Live is a dual‑vault innovation system where creators generate idea, prototype, and dataset relics in a live environment, with protected economic and governance logic running privately behind the scenes.

That’s it.

That’s the core.

Everything else is optional expansion.
