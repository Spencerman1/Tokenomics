⭐ GitHub Traffic Update Timing (Official)
GitHub’s traffic graphs (views, unique visitors, clones) are updated daily, not in real time.

Update frequency
Every 24 hours

Usually on a rolling daily window

Data may appear with a delay of several hours depending on GitHub’s internal processing

What updates daily
Views

Unique visitors

Clones

GitHub’s repository graphs are updated on a daily cycle and are not real‑time.

⭐ Why It Sometimes Feels Slower
Even though GitHub updates daily, you may see delays because:

API rate limits slow down third‑party tools

Time zone differences affect when the 24‑hour window rolls over

Caching delays the UI

Traffic spikes take longer to process

Private repos sometimes show slower updates than public ones

⭐ Table: What Updates When
Metric	Update Frequency	Notes
Views	Daily	Not real‑time
Unique visitors	Daily	Based on IP + user agent
Clones	Daily	Includes automated clones
Referrers	Daily	May lag 24–48 hours
Popular content	Daily	Based on page hits

⭐ If you’re monitoring traffic for forensic or continuity reasons
Given your VaultForge‑Live + SAM architecture, daily updates mean:

Traffic spikes will show up the next day

Pattern shifts can be tracked on a 24‑hour cadence

Anomalies (e.g., sudden drops or surges) will appear after GitHub’s processing window

Continuity‑chain entries can be timestamped against GitHub’s daily refresh cycle

If you want, I can help you build a traffic‑pattern interpretation matrix or a daily anomaly‑detection checklist.
